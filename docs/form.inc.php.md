Generates HTML form elements from PHP: This file defines multiple HTML tags that can be completely or partially generated by RedSea in PHP to be included in an HTML form in a template.

- **Namespace**: RedSea

# Class ``input``

- Uses: **``commonHtmlProperties``**

Defines an HTML input tag.


## Prototype

```
$object = new RedSea\input (
	string $inputType
)
```

## Properties

- Protected array ``$tagAttrArray``: The class defined array contains the ``<input>``tag specific attributes that define how the tag will work when rendered by a browser. This list will be extended by the ``commonHtmlPropertoes`` trait that will add the attributes that are common to all HTML tags.


- Protected array ``$inputTypeArray``: Contains the different types of ``<input>`` tags as this tag can render in many different ways. See [W3School's input tag reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp) for more details on how this tag works in HTML.

## Methods

### ``__construct()``
Class constructor.

#### Prototype
```
__construct (
	string $inputType
)
```

#### Parameters

- String ``$inputType`` A string value that must match a value in the ``inputTypeArray`` array. This is based on the available types defined in the HTML ``<input>`` tag.  for further details and the contents of the ``$inputTypeArray`` in this document plus the ``commonHtmlProperties`` trait.

#### Return values
- Boolean ``true`` on success. As a constructor, the object itself will be returned.
- Boolean ``false`` on failure. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

---

### ``render()``
Returns the HTML code for the tag as defined by the input type and other general settings included from the ``commonHtmlProperties`` trait.

#### Prototype

```
render();
```

#### Return value

- String containing the defined HTML ``<input>`` tag.


# Class ``label``

- Uses: **``commonHtmlProperties``**

This class allows the creation of a label tag, to be associated with certain form elements such as radiobuttons.

## Prototype
```
$object = new RedSea\label (
	string $displayValue,
	?string $boundControlID,
	?string $boundFormID
)
```

## Properties
- Protected array ``$tagAttrArray``: The class defined array contains the ``<label>``tag specific attributes that define how the tag will work when rendered by a browser. This list will be extended by the ``commonHtmlPropertoes`` trait that will add the attributes that are common to all HTML tags.


- Protected array ``$inputTypeArray``: Contains the different types of ``<input>`` tags as this tag can render in many different ways. See [W3School's input tag reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp) for more details on how this tag works in HTML.

## Methods

#### ``__construct()``

#### Prototype

```
__construct (
	string $displayValue=null, 
	?string $boundControlID=null,
	?string $boundFormID=null
)
```

#### Parameters
- String ``$labelValue``: Text to display on the label in the rendered HTML page

- Optional string|null ``$boundControlID``: ID of the form element that the label is related to. Default is ``NULL``.

- Optional string|null ``$boundFormID`` ID of the overall form that both the label, and if set the form element, belong to. Default is ``NULL``.

#### Return values
- Boolean ``true`` on success. As a constructor, the object itself will be returned.

- Boolean ``false`` on failure. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

### ``render()``
Returns the HTML code for the tag

#### Prototype

```
render();
```

#### Return value

- String containing the defined HTML ``<label>`` tag.

---

# Class ``select``

- Uses: **``commonHtmlProperties``**

Defines an HTML ``<select>`` tag and the associated ``<option>`` tags it contains.

Note that the class defines a quick add to generate embedded ``<option>``tags, it can also incorporate objects created by the ``option()`` class which allow full customisation.

## Prototype
```
$object = new RedSea\select (
	?string $outputFullTag=true
)
```

## Properties

- Protected array ``$tagAttrArray``: The class defined array contains the ``<select>``tag specific attributes that define how the tag will work when rendered by a browser. This list will be extended by the ``commonHtmlPropertoes`` trait that will add the attributes that are common to all HTML tags.

## Methods

### ``__construct()``

#### Prototype

```
__construct (
	?string $outputFillTag=true
)
```

#### Parameters

- Optional ``boolean`` $outputFullTag: If ``TRUE``, the full HTML code from ``<select>`` to ``</select>`` will be generated when the object is rendered. If ``FALSE``, only the contents of the select tag will be generated, but the ``<select>`` and ``</select>`` tags will be omitted.

#### Return values

This method does not return a value.

---

### ``quickAdd()``

Allows adding a simple option tag into the select object.

This is a simplified method that allows the creation of simple option tags inside the select object that contain a display label, a corresponding value to be submitted if the option is selected, and allows defining if the tag is selected or disabled.

This method does not allow CSS styling, events or other attributes other than ``selected``or ``disabled``.

It is also more memory friendly as it does not store a complete object but a simple HTML string, but if you need to add events or more specific styling, then you will need to instanciate and parameter a seperate ``option()`` object and add it into this class.

#### Prototype

```
 quickAdd (
 	?string $label=null,
 	?string $value=null,
 	?bool $isSelected=false,
 	?bool $isDisabled=false
)
```

#### Parameters 

- Optional string ``$label``: Text label to display in the option tag.

- Optional string ``$value``: Value to be set in the tag's value attribute.

- Optional bool ``$isSelected√π``: If ``TRUE``, the tag's selected attribute will be set, meaning that it will display when rendered in HTML with this value selected in the option list.

- Optional bool ``$isDisabled``: If ``TRUE``, the tag's disabled attribute will be set and the option will render as a greyed out disabled element.

#### Return values

- Boolean ``true`` on success.

- Boolean ``false`` on failure. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

---

### ``addOptionObject()``

Add a customisable option object to the select tag. This will be rendered as a selectable element inside the select tag. This allows you a more customisable - but heavier - way of adding an ``object``tag into the ``select``tag, as opposed to the simpler but less customisable ``quickAdd()`` method.

You will need to instanciate a seperate ``option()`` object and parareter it, then add it into this object through this method.

#### Prototype
```
addOptionObject (
	$optionObject
)
```
 
#### Parameters 
- Object ``$optionObject``: An instanciated RedSea 'option' object that has been set up for use.

#### Return values
- Boolean ``true`` on success.

- Boolean ``false`` on failure. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

### ``render()``
Returns the HTML code for the tag

#### Prototype

```
render();
```

#### Return value

- String containing the defined HTML ``<select>`` tag.

---

# Class ``option``

- Uses: **``commonHtmlProperties``**

This class allows the creation of individual option tags, that can either be rendered stand-alone or be added into a select box to be rendered as a complete HTML widget.

You can still access all the common methods that extends from the trait to customise events and common tags

## Prototype
```
 $object = new RedSea\option(
 	string $optionDisplayValue,
 	?string $optionInnerValue=null
)
```

## Properties
 
 - Protected array ``$tagAttrArray``: The class defined array contains the ``<option>``tag specific attributes that define how the tag will work when rendered by a browser. This list will be extended by the ``commonHtmlPropertoes`` trait that will add the attributes that are common to all HTML tags.

## Methods
 

### ``__construct()``

#### Prototype
```
__construct (
	string $optionDisplayValue,
	?string $optionInnerValue=null
)
```
 
#### Parameters 
- string ``$optionDisplayValue``: Text value to display in the tag. This can be any value (including a blank string), but an error will be raised if this is a null value.

- Optional string ``$optionInnerValue``: value to set on the tag's 'value' attribute that when selected will be sent back to a form handler on submission of the form that contains this element. If the value is ``null``, it will be ignored.

#### Return values
- Boolean ``true`` on success.
As a constructor, the object itself will be returned.

- Boolean ``false`` on failure. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

# Class ``GlobalPropertiesAndAttributes``

Static class to be used internally by the form (or any) HTML tag generator.

This will allow attributes and events to be added into the tag classes when needed, but avoid having a full array list of all global attributes and events copied into every object if they are not needed. This will allow an "on-demand" creation of attribute and event data avoiding un-necessary procesisng for each attribute and event that a tag class may use - but probably does not!

As a class defining static methods, this can be called without instanciation, optimising memory use.

The downside is that, opposed to a trait, the class cannot know anything implicit about the parent class unless it has been explicitly sent as an argument - probably a good thing as this enables less coupled code.

## Properties

- Private static ``$globalAttrArray``: Contains the global, common HTML tag attributes, which will complement the HTML tag generation methods that each contain a tag-specific attribute array.

- Private static ``$globalEventArray``: Contains a list of all currently known HMTL events that are common to each HTML tag.

## Methods

### ``validateandSetAttribute()``

Checks an attribute for coherency against the global attribute list and a class's custom attribute list.

If the attribute matches, returns an array to be loaded into the class's processable attribute list.

#### Prototype
```
globalPropertiesAndAttributes::validateAndSetAttribute (
	string $name,
	string $value,
	?array $tagSpecificArray = null
)

```
 
#### Parameters 
- String ``$name``: Attribute name to set. This attribute must be in the global attribute list or in the tag specific array of an object, if set.

- String ``$value``: Value to set. The value must match the type set in the tag global or specific array list

- Array ``$tagSpecificArray`` Tag specific array if a tag has specific attributes in addition to the global ones.


#### Return values
- On success, array containing the set value or false if the array element is not found or not valid. 

- Boolean ``false`` on failure. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``


### ``validateAndSetEvent()``
Checks and returns an event value array to be used in a tag against the list.

#### Prototype
```
validateAndSetEvent(
	string $name,
	string $value
)
```
 
#### Parameters 
- String ``$name``: Event name to set. If the event name does not match a known event in the list, the method will return false.

- String ``$value``: Event value to set.

#### Return values

- On success, array containing the set event value or false if the array element is not found.

- Boolean ``false`` on failure. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

# Trait ``commonHtmlProperties``

Defines common HTML tag attributes that most HTML elements share.

This class will be "absorbed" by all RedSea managed HTML tag classes, and so the methods and properties will be available as if the class was inherited and extended.

A trait was used given that PHP does not support multiple inheritance, and any extension of the HTML tag classes down the line would break the inheritance of the common properties, therefore they are included as a trait. If you are not familiar with traits, think of it as a sort of 'include' of functions.

Regarding the common HTML properties that are managed by this trait, please check out:

- For attributes and values see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes and the associated help per HTML tag to see specific attributes. 

- For events, see https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp.

## Methods


### ``type()``

#### Prototype
```
type (
	?string $tagType = null;
);
```
 
#### Parameters 
- Optional string ``$tagType``: Type of tag to set:
 - If ``null``, the current type of the tag is returned.
 - If string, the value will be set as the current tag type if no other type is already set otherwise

#### Return values
 - If ``$tagType`` is empty, then the method will return the current set value of of the tag
  - If ``$tagType`` is set correctly the method will return ``TRUE``
  - If ``$tagType`` is not set correctly, the method will return ``FALSE``.

 - On error: The method will return ``false``. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``.


### ``attribute()``

#### Prototype
```
attribute (
	string $attributeName,
	?string $attributeValue=null
)
```
 
#### Parameters 
- String ``$attributeName``: Name of the attribute to get, set or unset. The event name must already exist as a valid event name as defined by the static method ``GlobalPropertiesAndAttributes::validateAndSetAttribute``.

- String ``$attributeValue``: Value to set in the attribute.
 - If the string is set to NULL, the method acts as a getter: it will return the value for the attribute if the name is valid
 - If the string is set to empty string ("") the method acts as an "un"-setter, removing the event from the list of events and the attribute will no longer be rendered in the object.
 - If the string is set to any other value, the method acts as a setter, adding the event value to the object as long as the event exists as defined by ``GlobalPropertiesAndAttributes::validateAndSetAttribute``

#### Return values

Depending on accessing this method as a getter or setter:

- On success:
 - Getter: Will return the value that corresponds to the attribute name, or ``FALSE`` if the value is not set or the name is invalid.

 - Setter: Will return ``TRUE`` if the value was set, or ``FALSE`` if not. 

- On error: The method will return ``false``. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

### ``event()``

Get or set a tag object's events. This is a getter/setter method.

If an event name is set but not the event value, the method will return the current event value, if set.

If there is no event set, the method will return FALSE: As events are only actually strings internally, boolean false is never a value that will actually be rendered.

To unset an event, send an empty string (not a null string) as the event value.

#### Prototype
```
event (
	string $eventName,
	string $eventValue
)
```
 
#### Parameters 
- String ``$eventName``: Name of the event to get, set or unset. The event name must already exist as a valid event name as defined by the static method ``GlobalPropertiesAndAttributes::validateAndSetEvent``.

- String ``$eventValue``: Value to set in the event.
 - If the string is set to NULL, the method acts as a getter: it will return the value for the event if the name is valid
 - If the string is set to empty string ("") the method acts as an "un"-setter, removing the event from the list of events and the event will no longer be rendered in the object.
 - If the string is set to any other value, the method acts as a setter, adding the event value to the object as long as the event exists as defined by ``GlobalPropertiesAndAttributes::validateAndSetEvent``

#### Return values

Depending on accessing this method as a getter or setter:

- On success:
 - Getter: Will return the value that corresponds to the attribute name, or ``FALSE`` if the value is not set or the name is invalid.

 - Setter: Will return ``TRUE`` if the value was set, or ``FALSE`` if not. 

- On error: The method will return ``false``. In addition, error details can be obtained by calling the static debug and error handling method ``debug::getLastError()``

singleLineTagRender (
	string $tagName,
	?string $tagHasValue=null
) 
```
 
#### Parameters 
- String ``$tagName``: Name of the HTML tag to render.

- Optional string ``$tagHasValue`` If the tag is not self closing and has a value to display (such as a label, a...) then the data to display in the tag will be specified here.

#### Return values
- String: Rendered single line HTML tag.

---





### ``()``

#### Prototype
```

```
 
#### Parameters 
- 

#### Return values
